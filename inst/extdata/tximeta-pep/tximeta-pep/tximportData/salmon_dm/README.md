# About the two quantification files

* `SRR1197474` is quantified against release 98 of the Drosophila
  melanogaster transcriptomes (cDNA + ncRNA) from Ensembl
* `SRR1197474.plus` is quantified against this release with an
  additional artificial transcript "Newgene" (a series of 960 bp of
  ACGT) added to the beginning of the FASTA file (for demonstration of
  linkedTxomes in tximeta package).
